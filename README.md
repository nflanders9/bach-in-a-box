Bach in a Box
=============
Composing Bach Chorales using Python



This project is not yet functional, but eventually it will be able to compose Bach Chorales based on an initial random
condition and then exploiting the rules and structure of a Bach Chorale in order to compose the rest of the piece. The
structure of the Chorale will be based on a Markov probability chain, so the program will generate different pieces even
if the initial condition is the same. Ultimately, we hope to format the piece as a MusicXML file and then transcribe and
play it via the Noteflight API.
